## Installation
To set up the text editor, you need to install Node.js and several npm packages.

Node Package Manager (npm) is a software manager and installer that allows you to install and manage the required modules for the Node.js project. It intelligently handles dependency conflicts and generates a package.json file that contains project details.

This application utilizes the following npm packages:

*cexpress.js: npm install express
* Webpack: npm install --save-dev webpack
* webpack-dev-server: npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev
* WebpackPwaManifest: npm install --save-dev webpack-pwa-manifest
* Babel: npm install babel
* CSS-loader: npm install --save-dev css-loader
* Concurrently: npm install concurrently --save
* IndexedDB: npm install idb

All the required modules are listed in the package.json file. To install them, open the command line interface or integrated terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run the command "npm install". This will install all the necessary dependencies for the application
